# Active matter simulations
## Usage
Run `clear` to **permanently delete** all simulation files (i.e., all files in 
`/data/sims`). Use with discretion. 


## TODO 
- [x] Run and Tumble (10/1)
- [ ] Differential equation (10/8)
- [ ] Update on experiments (10/15)
- 4/5 mm resolution

## OCT 22 
- [x] Fix Msd, verify transition to slope 1 occurs at around 1 for normalized 
      time lag, las ttime should correspond to simulation time 
- [ ] Test camera and hexbug video 
- [x] Write code to load in images 
- [x] Object identification
